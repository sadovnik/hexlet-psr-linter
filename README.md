This is a linter for PHP with aim to implement all possible [PSR](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/) rules.

This project was originally started as part of [Hexlet](https://hexlet.io)'s traineeship, but actually developed a long time after. However the `hexlet-` prefix remains unchanged.

Thanks to [Roman Lakhtadyr](https://github.com/pldin601) for review. üôèüèª
